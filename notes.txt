Column properties are likely to be highly important in determining how outcomes and subgroups are combined within studies.

"Subgroup" is of function "Subgroup within study"
"Comparison" is of function "Comparison"
"Outcome (specific)" is of function "Outcome"
"Time point" is of function "Time point"
"Outcome Group", "outcome type", "study design", "media type", "Ferguson" are all of function "Moderator"

For multiple rows per study, CMA offers the following options:
"Use the mean of the selected [foo]"
"Use all of the selected [foo], assuming independence" "Use the first [foo], based on this sequence." 

See attached screenshots for the options and their selections.



Subgroups are aggregated across, as study is used as the unit of analysis. This will be a problem if effect sizes reported in subgroups are not independent -- control groups will be double- or triple-counted again.

All outcomes.specific are used, assuming independence. This will be a very serious problem if a study reports two outcomes in the same Outcome / Outcome.type / design / media.type cell.
